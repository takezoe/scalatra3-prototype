# scalatra3-prototype

Prototype of Scalatra3 which will be fully restructured and built on the top of http4s!

Scalatra3 respects existing Scalatra API, but it will elliminate ambiguous APIs and servlet dependent API. Also it will elliminate excessive flexibility and abstraction to keep framework simple and lightweight.

Sample application is [here](https://github.com/takezoe/scalatra3-prototype/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/scalatra/HelloController.scala). You can run this application by `sbt core/run`.
